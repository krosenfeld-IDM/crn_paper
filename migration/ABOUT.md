Due to the 20 file limit I added the main `starsim/starsim` directory (w/ no sub-directories except for `diseases/sir.py`)

Prompt:
```
I have the following Python script for starsim that may contain some errors, particularly in keyword arguments, attribute access, and method calls. Could you please help me identify and fix these errors? Please ensure that all keyword arguments are correctly used, attributes are properly accessed, and method calls are correctly implemented. Please provide the corrected, complete script in your response.
```

Quick notes:
- No script runs w/o errors
- run_comparison.py has error identified by vscode
